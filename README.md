# SpineJ
SpineJ is a semi-automatic ImageJ plugin that is specifically designed for quantifying nanoscale structures like dendritic spines. SpineJ comes with an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface, facilitating fast, accurate, and unbiased analysis of spine morphology.

### Plugin

A jar file of the plugin can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/flevet/SpineJ/releases/tag/v1.0). The repository contains also a manual and a STED image used in the paper. 

Source code is still being cleaned up and should follow shortly (hopefully...).
